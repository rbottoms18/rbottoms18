### Welcome!

I graduated from the University of Washington with my Masters in Applied and Computational Mathematics in 2024. I'm passionate about programming and I am actively looking for Data Analysis or Software related roles.

Some of the projects I've completed are:

#### [Kuzushiji classifcation using machine learning](https://github.com/rbottoms18/kuzushiji-classification)

I implemented three different image classification models in Python, two using machine learning, to attempt to classify different kinds of antiquated Japanese characters. I used a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier, a Fully Connected Neural Network, and a Convoluational Neural Network.
I compared the effectiveness of these three algorithsm on both full data and dimension reduced (compressed) data, as well as comparing wall-clock runtimes.

#### [An investigation of a model of continuous dose radiation therapy](https://github.com/rbottoms18/tumor-model)

I investigated a mathematical model of continuous dose radiation therapy for cancer proposed in a paper by Neira, Gago-Arias, Guiu-Souto, and Pardo-Montero (2020). I compared the full model with the reduced, computationally-easier model
they proposed to determine whether they had the same qualatative structures. I also attempted to formulate a system of stochastic differential equations for the model, and solve these numerically.
